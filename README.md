I have created the react based application which is used to live healthier and better life for all age of peoples.
The task is to build the prototype for the 65+ years old peoples to live healthier and better life.

By considering the age restrictions,
    I have build the software or application which is very useful for those peoples, by considering the physical 
health I have add the feature of exercise for the old age peoples. This application is not only useful for old
age peoples but also for the young people. Anyone can do the exercise based on there requirement or there need 
or there age. In these there is a filter which you can apply as per your choice. As per your choice you can apply
features like which body exercise do you want to do. All the exercise has not been done by old age peoples.

By considering the mental health of old people they need some entertainment, So I am trying to add some entertainment
based videos like youtube videos. which will make there mood fresh and keep them happy.
